      <p>Tom Kelly had a vision to build an all-in-one fundraising platform for non-profit organizations and schools. Playing the role of a technical cofounder, we've worked closely with him over the last 3 years to create a system that not only drives a sustainable business, but also provide custom solutions that helps to grow and create a fundraising strategy based on customers goals</p>

    <h2>The Brief</h2>

    <p>Tom first approached us in January 2013 about his fundraising platform concept. He wanted a website which can act as an online auction platform and a premiere online marketplace which helps to increase donations and bids. This online auction platform would allow business sellers to sell products and items in large quantities to millions of users across USA. Buyers, would then bid in an on-line auction environment on the product listed in individual auctions.</p>

      <h2>Proving the Concept</h2>
      <p>In our first meeting with Tom, we both thought that we would be discussing a fundraising platform. However, by the end of the meeting, we concluded that the right place to start was with a custom software to support the unique service aspect of his business. It wasn't perfect, but it didn't need to be — as a proof of concept, it helped him secure capital and begin to run trials with customers, using Facebook to acquire initial users.</p>

      <h2>Initial Successes and Speed Bumps</h2>
      <p>After 24fundraiser’s MVP launch, Techracers and Tom worked together to figure out what to do next. We needed to establish a continuous product development cycle so that we could expand the system as new customers came in and business opportunities arose.</p>

      <p>Establishing a cadence was critical to keeping the site stable. Tom had plenty of ideas for what to build next, we had to be fast without breaking things?</p>

      <p>The solution was to take a data-driven approach to prioritize features. Following the MVP, we established a process for every sprint review:</p>

      <h2>A Pleasurable Auction Experience for Customers</h2>
      <p>With 24Fundraiser’s versatile auction platform your event’s potential is unlimited. For example, our clients have conducted online auctions at galas, concerts, outdoor sports events, school concerts and wine tastings, just to name a few. The only limit is your imagination.The platform is optimized for performance, availability and scalability with unique functionalities of an online auction to manage and track all bidding related activities.
      We used A/B testing to measure success. We released new versions of the on boarding process to 50% of customers at a time, while the other 50% saw the old version. This allowed us to observe user behavior and determine which version was more effective. In the end, we found that shortening the five-step process to three steps did improve the conversion rate, especially for mobile users.</p>

    <h2>Looking at the Future</h2>
    <p>We’ve nurtured a collaborative and productive relationship with Tom Kelly. During our engagement, we’ve discovered a segment of the population who do want the streamlined their bidding process in online auction. We designed and built a robust and scalable admin system and consumer-facing website that will support Tom now and in the future. Our support for Tom, like our process, is ongoing and constantly developing under the mantra “Make it better”.</p>

    If this was our second program year using 24Fundraiser. We used the software
    to sell tickets to our auction and that went really well. Our population isn't tech
    savy but the program was so easy to use that we had no problems

    As a fundraising consultatnt, I am constantly looking for new fundraising
    ideas for my clients. Recently I found 24Fundraiser . Your program is
    wonderful . And the support and training I received was top-notch.
    <br>
    <br>
    My client raised over $45,000  at the first event we ran using 24Fundraiser.
    This was more than double what they raised last year. We were able to highlight
    some of the high-ticket auction items that were auctioned off by the auctioner
    the night of the auction . This helped us generate interest prior to the auction
